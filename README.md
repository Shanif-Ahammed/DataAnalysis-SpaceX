# DataAnalysis-SpaceX

### Summary of methodologies
* Data Collection through API
* Data Collection with Web Scraping
* Data Wrangling
* Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL
* Exploratory Data Analysis with Data Visualization
* Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium
* Machine Learning Prediction
### Conclusion
* We can conclude that
* The Tree Classifier Algorithm is the best Machine Learning approach for this dataset.
* The low weighted payloads (which define as 4000kg and below) performed better 
than the heavy weighted payloads.
* Starting from the year 2013, the success rate for SpaceX launches is increased, 
directly proportional time in years to 2020, which it will eventually perfect the 
launches in the future.
* KSC LC-39A have the most successful launches of any sites; 76.9%
* SSO orbit have the most success rate; 100% and more than 1 occurrence
